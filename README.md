## V-Majesty Diffusion v1.2
##### Formerly known as Princess Generator ver. Victoria
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/multimodalart/MajestyDiffusion/blob/main/v.ipynb)

A [Dango233](https://github.com/Dango233) and [apolinario (@multimodalart)](https://github.com/multimodalart) Colab notebook implementing [crowsonkb](https://github.com/crowsonkb/v-diffusion-pytorch)'s V-Objective Diffusion, with the following changes: 
  - Added [Dango233](https://github.com/Dango233) parallel multi-model diffusion (e.g.: run `cc12m_1` and `yfcc_2` at the same time - with or without lerping)
  - Added [Dango233](https://github.com/Dango233) cuts, augs and attributes scheduling
  - Added [Dango233](https://github.com/Dango233) mag and clamp settings

  - Added [crowsonkb](https://github.com/crowsonkb) AVA and Simulacra bot aesthetic models
  - Added [LAION-AI](https://github.com/LAION-AI/aesthetic-predictor) aesthetic pre-calculated embeddings
  - Added [open_clip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip) gradient checkpointing
  - Added [Dango233](https://github.com/Dango233) inpainting mode
  - Added [apolinario (@multimodalart)](https://github.com/multimodalart) "internal upscaling" (upscales the output with `yfcc_2` or `openimages`) 
  - Added [apolinario (@multimodalart)](https://github.com/multimodalart) savable settings and setting library (including `dango33-defaults`, `disco-diffusion-defaults` default settings)

## TODO
### Please feel free to help us in any of these tasks!
  - [ ] Figure out better defaults and add more settings to the settings library (contribute with a PR!)
  - [ ] Add all notebooks to a single pipeline where on model can be the output of the other (similar to [Centipede Diffusion](https://github.com/Zalring/Centipede_Diffusion))
  - [ ] Add all notebooks to the [MindsEye UI](multimodal.art/mindseye)
  - [ ] Modularise everything
  - [ ] Create a command line version
  - [ ] Add an inpainting UI
  - [ ] Improve performance, both in speed and VRAM consumption
  - [ ] More technical issues will be listed on [https://github.com/multimodalart/majesty-diffusion/issues](issues)
