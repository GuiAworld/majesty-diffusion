A [Dango233](https://github.com/Dango233) and [apolinario (@multimodalart)](https://github.com/multimodalart) Colab notebook implementing [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis)' Latent Diffusion, with the following changes:
  - Added CLIP Guidance
  - Added Dango233 magical **new** step and upscaling scheduling
  - Added Dango233 cuts, augs and attributes scheduling
  - Added Dango233 mag and clamp settings
  - Added Dango233 linear ETA scheduling
  - Added Dango233 negative prompts for Latent Diffusion Guidance
  - Added [Jack000](https://github.com/Jack000) [GLID-3 XL](https://github.com/Jack000/glid-3-xl) watermark free fine-tuned model
  - Added [dmarx](https://github.com/dmarx/) [Multi-Modal-Comparators](https://github.com/dmarx/Multi-Modal-Comparators) for CLIP and CLIP-like models
  - Added [open_clip](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip) gradient caching
  - Added [crowsonkb](https://github.com/crowsonkb/v-diffusion-pytorch) aesthetic models
  - Added Dango233 inpainting mode
  - Added multimodalart savable settings and setting library (including `colab-free-default`, `dango233-princess`, `the-other-zippy` shared settings. Share yours with us!)

## V-Majesty Diffusion v1.2
##### Formerly known as Princess Generator ver. Victoria
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/multimodalart/MajestyDiffusion/blob/main/v.ipynb)

A [Dango233](https://github.com/Dango233) and [apolinario (@multimodalart)](https://github.com/multimodalart) Colab notebook implementing [crowsonkb](https://github.com/crowsonkb/v-diffusion-pytorch)'s V-Objective Diffusion, with the following changes: 
  - Added Dango233 parallel multi-model diffusion (e.g.: run `cc12m_1` and `yfcc_2` at the same time - with or without lerping)
  - Added Dango233 cuts, augs and attributes scheduling
  - Added Dango233 mag and clamp settings
